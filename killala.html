An interactive map is available on the <a title="Killala Diocese website" href="http://www.killaladiocese.org/map/map.php">Killala Diocese website</a>.
<p>The Diocese of Killala was created in 1111 and its boundaries delineated by the Synod of Rathbreasail. More information is available on <a title="Roman Catholic Diocese of Killala" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Killala">Wikipedia</a>. Several Feeney's have been baptised in its many churches over the years, including my own grandfather at St. James Church in Easkey. I took this photo while chatting with a retired priest there in 2007.
